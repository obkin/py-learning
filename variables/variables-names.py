# You should use snake_case for declaring variables:

carname = "Toyota"
car_name = "Toyota"
carname2 = "Lexus"
_car_name = "BMW" # is inactive because you don't use it anywhere


# If variable name contains more than 2 words, u can use camelCase / PascalCase / snake_case:
mySisterName = 'Lesia'
MySisterName = 'Lesia'
my_sister_name = 'Lesia'
